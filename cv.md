#### ABOUT ME

>Free Time Activities: My personal
interests include sports and an active
lifestyle. I really love speedcubing,
which not only gives me the
opportunity to get adrenaline, but also
helps me keep a good form of thinking.
I am also passionate about creating
and printing 3D models, which gives
me the opportunity to creatively
express and develop my technical
skills. Reading books and news in the
field of programming helps me enrich
my knowledge and skills in my field,
and allows me to keep abreast of the
latest technologies and innovations.
This helps me to be more competent
and efficient in my work, and gives me
the opportunity to identify new
opportunities for professional growth.
In general, this makes me a more
qualified and competent specialist in
my field.
